# DungeonEscape_UFA

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

(Still in progress)
2nd project out of 4 from a Udemy course. I am going through this course to learn the ins and outs of the UE5 so that I'll have enough knowledge to make games full time. I will be working on this when I have time to outside of schoolwork and my job.

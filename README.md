# Project 2 -  DungeonEscape_UFA

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This repository contains the second of four small gameplay projects completed as part of a Udemy course that's focused on learning how to use Unreal Engine and gameplay programming fundamentals

## Project Overview
A first person dungeon style prototype focused on player interaction, simple inventory logic, and environmental puzzles.

## Planned Features
- Inventory system used internally to track collected items
- Ability to collect items to place in internally tracked inventory
- Doors that open based on player placed objects
- Puzzle based progression using environmental triggers
- Basic dungeon style level layout and traversal challenges

## Implemented Features
- Created an initial test level for gameplay experimentation
- Set up basic world lighting including directional light and ambient lighting
- Blocked out a simple test environment using basic geometric shapes
- Prepared the level for early interaction and gameplay testing
- Interactable pressure plates for opening doors
- Doors that open based on player interaction with pressure plate

## What I’m Learning
- Designing gameplay systems that interact through shared state
- Using triggers and collision to drive gameplay events
- Structuring gameplay logic using Unreal Engine systems
